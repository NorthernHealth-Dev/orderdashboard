If hemmorhage is bad enough you need a bakri, this should already be done, and if not, should add.\u00a0\n\n\nI would change urine output order sentence to be parameter based... so that if urine output is too low that provider is notified. i.e. < 1 cc/kg/hr or something. Will have to look at trauma and shock guidelines and OB specific guidelines to see if any evidence based recommendations. Though this might be part of general PPH orderset instead.\u00a0\n\n\nInclude parameter for volume/measurement of blood draining into the bakri bag. I have no suggestion for number and can't find any evidence based reccomendation.\u00a0\n\n\nAtibiotics: SOGC no. 431 Postpartum hemmorhage and hemorrhagic shock guidelines state antibiotics should be considered if not already given (consider making checkbox on ours unchecked rather than checked by default... although reasonable either way).\n\n\nOther antibiotic choice to be considered could be cefoxotin. Could check local antibiograms. Really, anything broad spectrum should be great.\u00a0\n\n\nCould change \"remove vaginal packing...\" sentences to \"if vaginal packing in place, remove...\" (we rarely pack the vagina after putting a bakri balloon, so it might confuse people if it is written like it assumes packing is there)\n\n", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Carl Severson"}]}
