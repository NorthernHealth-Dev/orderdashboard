Likely not as necessary in ICU settings, but would be a good practice pattern to have. Additionally, we should decide if relying on Cerner's warnings when opioids are ordered is enough, or if there should be an auto discontinuation of prior opioid orders.", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Salpy Kelian"}]}
