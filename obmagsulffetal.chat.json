(2) Might be worth including whole definition. For women with imminent preterm birth antenatal mag sulf should be considered for fetal neuroprotection. Imminent preterm birth is defined as (a) active labour with \u22654 cm of cervical dilation with or without PPROM or (b) planned preterm birth for fetal or maternal indications. (3) Add order to discontinue infusion at delivery, if delivery is no longer imminent, or max 24 hours. (4) 1g/hour infusion after bolus can be default un-checked as it is optional.(5) add note that delivery should NOT be delayed in order to admister mag sulf for fetal neuroprotection if there are maternal and/or feal indications for urgent delivery (SOGC guideline quote). (6) Add note that monitoring serum Mg levels is NOT required.\u00a0", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Carl Severson"}, {"title": "Comment", "to": "Everyone", "location": "Terrace", "date": "05-08-2023", "message": "Calcium gluconate should not be default checked.
