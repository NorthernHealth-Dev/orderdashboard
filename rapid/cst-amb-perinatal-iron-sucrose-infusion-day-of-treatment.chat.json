For example, in Terrace, we don't have the capacity to have a labour nurse auscultate fetal hear, and iron infusions are done in the public health unit.\u00a0\nGet pharmacy to clarify the duration of the infusion (not clear on this preview). Also get pharmacy to clarify the interval for repeat doses, should be q2 days for 3 doses / 1000mg. The overall dosing should be clear as well (can be calculated via different formulas that take specific patient considerations like weight, into consideration). The indications for continuous fetal monitoring should be clear (here it states that CEFM should be done if there is a maternal adverse reaction... should also include auscultation of abnormal fetal heart rate, for example). The duration of the CEFM is imprtant, is it just an NST, or is there criteria to discontinue it.\u00a0", "type": "physician", "by": "Prollius | Strydom | Severson"}, {"title": "monoferric", "to": "Everyone", "date": "02-07-2023", "message": "can we add monoferric to this order set", "type": "physician", "by": "Lindsay Benoit"}]}
