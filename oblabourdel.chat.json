(3) morphine and fentanyl should not be given for 5 days. (4) presumably oxytocin orders are for administration at delivery when anterior shoulder delivered. (5) Need to clarify at what point during labour fentanly is appropriate to use and morphine is appropriate to use otherwise will end up having to narcan a bunch of babies.", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Carl Severson"}]}
