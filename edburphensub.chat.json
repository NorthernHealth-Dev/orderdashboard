There is a very well-described induction protocol in the BCCSU regarding microinduction vs conventional induction (pt should be in withdrawal already). However, what is written here doens't really match anything, and the key is follow up with a provider in days to come, NOT just discharge without any ongoing doses. So, wondering if we can clarify that. Thanks", "type": "Doctor", "by": "P. Jiang"}]}
