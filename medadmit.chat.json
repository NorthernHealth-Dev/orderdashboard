See the personal order set I created and sent to you Andrew. </li>\n\n<li>Diet: reorganize so that it\u2019s a drop down for diet (regular vs diabetic etc) so that it\u2019s not an endless scroll.\u00a0\n\nFluids: again, drop down selection is deal.</li>\n\n<li>Medications: typically come after investigations. We should have a formal review of \u201cdiscretionary orders\u201d in general at all sites. There\u2019s a lot of garbage like cough meds on the default orders at PRRH. Suggest discretionary admission medications be broken out into its own module and kept up to date. That way we are not trying to find each iteration of an admission order set. <strong>Take advantage of the modularity of powerplans so that commonly used things (e.g. patient care, investigations, discretionary meds) are broken out into their own modules and embedded into each powerplan as needed.</strong></li>\n\n<li>Labs: This is very long and can be structured differently. Many of these are not as commonly ordered as one would think. </li>", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Salpy Kelian"}]}
