It would not be the cardiac rehab one.\n\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\nIf possible, please separate this into two sections: section 1 - diuresis, section 2 - goal directed medical therapy.\u00a0\n\nUnder section 1 - Diuresis:\n\n-Note: Volume overload requires diuresis to target an average weight loss / fluid deficit of 1kg/1L per day. If on home furosemide, start with double their home dose.\n\n-furosemide: you should have a general option here in addition to pre-filled targets. Include daily, BID, and TID frequencies. IV and PO routes.\u00a0\n\n-metolazone should be under this section as well\n\n\n\n\nSection 2 - Goal directed medical therapy:\n\n-Note: GDMT is to introduce all 4 pillars of therapy (ARNI/ACEi/ARB, BB, MRA, SGLT2i) within the first 4 weeks and to reach optimal doses within 3 months.\u00a0\n\n-missing dapagliflozin 10 mg PO (unsure if pharmacare covers empagliflozin). Avoid starting if eGFR <25 (may continue if already on dapagliflozin)\n\n-remove the \u201cclass II-IIIa symptoms\u201d from the spironolactone tip\n\n-consider moving both the nitrate+hydralazine combo to renal dysfunction section as these are used in lieu of ACE/ARB/ARNI\n\n\n\n\nLaboratory:\n\n-Unclear why there are two entries for BNP\n\n-add a note \u201cBNP or NT-proBNP should not be used to guide medical management of acute heart failure exacerbation. Use volume assessments to guide diuresis.\u201d", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Salpy Kelian"}]}
