For example, is this supposed to be used for pregnancy loss, induced abortion, ectopic, postpartum, during pregnancy? If so that may change orders and comments. (1) Is it worth including information about indications for winrho here, or is that captured elsewhere?\u00a0 (2) There is an alternative dosing regime of 100-120 micrograms at 28 and then 34 weeks that could be considered here. (3) If giving for miscarriage or abortion or ectopic or anything else at less than 12 weeks may give 120 microgram dose (but not sure if that is in alignment with our formulary options, need to ask pharmacy.\n\n(4) Consent for Rh immune globulin can be verbal or written as per SOGC guidelines. (5) Could get more in the weeds depending on when this orderset is intended to be used. )", "type": "Doctor", "by": "Carl Severson"}]}
