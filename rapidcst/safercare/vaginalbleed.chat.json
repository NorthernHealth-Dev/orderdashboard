Neither should estrogen or progesterone. I have seen TXA given to many people with pregnancy loss. I think we'll have to do some work to make that clear.\u00a0\nContraindications to estrogen should be listed before giving estrogen or OCP (active VTE, malignany, migrane with aurora, etc).\u00a0\nIf have containdications to estrogen can give medroxyprogesterone 20mg PO bid.\u00a0\nOther treatment modalities for acute (non pregnancy related) vaginal bleeding include: Oral contraceptive, 2 pills per day (total 35mcg estrogren) x5 days, then 1 pill per day.", "type": "physician", "by": "Carl Severson"}]}
