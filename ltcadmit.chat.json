For example, there are 3 dimenhydrinate meds (luckily those are followed closely with the dose and route). However, loperamide there are 2 lines with the same, but you have to read over to the R hand side to see which dose / route to give. I would advise getting consistency with where a doctor can quickly glance at the screen to identify the 1. Drug name. 2. Route. 3. Dose. (I personally prefer tabs, but as long as it's consistent and easy to see, I would accept it)", "type": "Doctor", "by": "P. Jiang"}]}
